## Make a difference -- provide input on a survey 

   The Bureau of Reclamation has allocated $60 million to mitigate drought impacts on the lower Rio Grande. The Water Resources Research Institute (WRRI) is seeking public input related to how to spend this money. 

You can make a difference to the health of the Rio Grande in southern New Mexico by providing input!

They have an [online survey](https://survey123.arcgis.com/share/2acd82fb2ab94a9e915283875d4fdc1d) for people to provide prioritization of different strategies and, if applicable, to propose specific water projects. It would be great if a large number of people (you!) could respond. The deadline is June 15 (this week!).

   [The survey](https://survey123.arcgis.com/share/2acd82fb2ab94a9e915283875d4fdc1d) can be completed in just a few minutes -- you can do it now! It has 5 pages:

- page 1: give your contact info and interest in participating in working meetings
- page 2 : Asks for input on "strategies" (broader than specific projects). It gives 11 such strategies, plus space to add up to 3 of your own, then you move them around to put them in your preferred priority. See below for a recommendation.
- page 3 : asks for input on "project prioritization", which gives their proposed evaluation scheme ..... but doesn't provide any area for input!
- page 4 : asks for specific project ideas. You can skip if you donâ€™t have one.
- page 5 : final page for "any additional comments" and submission

We hope that you can complete pages 1 and 2 and then submit it (with any additional comments you might have) on the final page.

For page 2, they provide 11 strategies to rank, and allow for responders to add up to 3 more; you then drag them around to put them in your priority order. We suggest the following priority order (our additional strategies are indicated with Other), but you can of course choose your own:
1. Other 1 : Reauthorize the federal Rio Grande project to allow for environmental water transfers and instream flows to benefit fish and wildlife
1. Create and/or sustain areas of bosque (which has river health, wildlife habitat, and recreation benefits), with an emphasis on high quality habitat for native riparian birds
1. Integrated river management program to restore a bosque, natural river health and functions, and riparian habitat throughout the river corridor
1. Other 2 : Moratorium on new pecan and any other high, fixed-demand water use crops, and implementation of program to incentivize retiring existing irrigated agricultural lands to establish native habitat 
1. Other 3 : Include more diverse set of stakeholders, including the general public, tribal entities, academic and scientific communities, environmental organizations, and the recreation industry, in decisions related to water management administration and use 
1. Aim to achieve groundwater resiliency for today and future generations (recharge to the aquifer is balanced with groundwater use by combinations of strategies)
1. Policies and programs to voluntarily incentivize farm water demand reduction and conservation (e.g. cover crops, shifts to profitable low-water use crops)
1. Restore upper watersheds to reduce floods and sediments washing into the valley, including grazing management to advance and support restoration and respond to droughts
1. Program to improve and coordinate regulations that limit development in flood zones
1. Projects that recharge groundwater aquifers through capturing a portion of stormwater/flood flows (maintaining flows for downstream riparian areas)
1. Use of stormwater/flood flows as an alternative water source for agriculture and bosque riparian areas
1. Improve EBID infrastructure to conserve water
1. Reduce flood risks and sediment transport through improving built infrastructure
1. Add ability for flood control dams to store stormwater for agricultural and recharge use

Please help to restore a flowing river by responding! Your input can make a difference.
