## Make a difference -- provide input on a survey 

   The Bureau of Reclamation has allocated $60 million of taxpayer dollars to mitigate drought impacts on the lower Rio Grande. The Water Resources Research Institute (WRRI) seeks public input on how to spend this money. 

**Please help to restore a flowing river by responding! Your input can make a difference.**

They have an [online survey](https://survey123.arcgis.com/share/2acd82fb2ab94a9e915283875d4fdc1d) for people to rank strategies to mitigate droughts. It would be great if a large number of people (you!) could respond. **The deadline for input is June 30.**

   [The survey](https://survey123.arcgis.com/share/2acd82fb2ab94a9e915283875d4fdc1d) can be completed in just a few minutes -- you can do it now! It has 5 pages:

### Quick roadmap of survey

   [Link to survey](https://survey123.arcgis.com/share/2acd82fb2ab94a9e915283875d4fdc1d)

- page 1: give your contact info and interest in participating in working meetings
- page 2 : Asks you to rank "strategies" to mitigate drought. It gives 11 such strategies, plus space to add up to 3 others. [Below](projects#ranking) is our recommended ranking.
- page 3 : asks for input on "project prioritization", which gives their proposed evaluation scheme.  If you have any comments on their approach, you can provide them in the general comments box on page 5.
- page 4 : asks for specific project ideas. You can skip if you don’t have one. If you are interested in adding some, see [this page](projects) for some information on other projects that have been submitted.
- page 5 : final page for "any additional comments" and submission. See [this page](comments) for some possibile comments.

**We hope that you can at least complete pages 1 and 2 and then submit it (with any additional comments you might have) on the final page.**

### Our recommended ranking for page 2

<A LABEL=ranking> 

For page 2, they provide 11 strategies to rank, and allow for responders to add up to 3 more; you then drag them around to put them in your priority order but, of course, you can modify as you see fit.
You will first have to enter the "Other #1, #2, and #3 strategies, e.g., by cutting and pasting from below) 
1. Other 1 : Reauthorize the federal Rio Grande project to allow for environmental water transfers and environmental flows to benefit native wildlife and their habitat
1. Integrated river management program to restore a bosque, natural river health and functions, and riparian habitat throughout the river corridor
1. Create and/or sustain areas of bosque (which has river health, wildlife habitat, and recreation benefits), with an emphasis on high quality habitat for native riparian birds
1. Other 2 : Include more diverse set of stakeholders, including the general public, tribal entities, academic and scientific communities, environmental organizations, and the recreation industry, in decisions related to water management, administration, and use 
1. Other 3 : Moratorium on new pecan and any other high, fixed-demand water use crops, and implementation of program to incentivize fallowing existing irrigated agricultural lands to establish native grassland, shrub, and riparian habitat 
1. Policies and programs to voluntarily incentivize farm water demand reduction and conservation (e.g. cover crops, shifts to profitable low-water use crops)
1. Aim to achieve groundwater resiliency for today and future generations (recharge to the aquifer is balanced with groundwater use by combinations of strategies)
1. Restore upper watersheds to reduce floods and sediments washing into the valley, including grazing management to advance and support restoration and respond to droughts
1. Program to improve and coordinate regulations that limit development in flood zones
1. Projects that recharge groundwater aquifers through capturing a portion of stormwater/flood flows (maintaining flows for downstream riparian areas)
1. Use of stormwater/flood flows as an alternative water source for agriculture and bosque riparian areas
1. Improve EBID infrastructure to conserve water
1. Reduce flood risks and sediment transport through improving built infrastructure
1. Add ability for flood control dams to store stormwater for agricultural and recharge use

**Please help to restore a flowing river by responding! Your input can make a difference. The deadline is June 30. Do it now!**
