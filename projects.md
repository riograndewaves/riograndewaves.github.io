- Trickle charging the aquifer
  - Location: Caballo dam to state line
  - Description: We propose a simple project : to maintain low-level flows in the Rio Grande outside of the irrigation season that will recharge the aquifer through the river channel, support native habitat, while at the same time keeping all of the water in New Mexico in an efficient storage location ... the aquifer.  At the WRRI workshop, it was stated that the most effective location to recharge the aquifer is through the river channel. The best native habitat is also located along the river channel; however, the ability to restore habitat is severely limited by the lack of water in the river for a large fraction of the year. Given drought and surface water shortage, farmers irrigate predominantly from the aquifer. Finally, evaporative losses from the aquifer are negligible and far less than from a reservoir.
We propose that low level in-stream flows be maintained year-round to achieve these goals. When there is no requirement for downstream delivery, the flows should be reduced to a minimum, but non-zero, level, and can be adjusted such that water flows no farther than the state line. The goal is for all of the water that is released off-season to trickle down into the aquifer and to support habitat along the river corridor.
  - Goals addressed: #2 and #4
  - Landownership: There is no impact on land ownership.
  - Water rights : Water is retained in the basin, but in the aquifer. Surface water deliveries during irrigation season will be reduced by the amount of water that is released off-season, but this water remains available in the aquifer -- with reduced evaporative losses -- for parties with groundwater rights.
  - Maintenance : Little to none, although one might consider using funds to establish a monitoring program to evaluate project success

Integrated river management program to restore a bosque, natural river health and functions, and riparian habitat throughout the river corridor

Create and/or sustain areas of bosque (which has river health, wildlife habitat, and recreationbenefits), with an emphasis on high quality habitat for native riparian bird

Aim to achieve groundwater resiliency for today and future generations (recharge to the aquifer is balanced with groundwater use by combinations of strategies)

Policies and programs to voluntarily incentivize farm water demand reduction and conservation (e.g. cover crops, shifts to profitable low-water use crops)

Restore upper watersheds to reduce floods and sediments washing into the valley, including grazing management to advance and support restoration and respond to droughts

Program to improve and coordinate regulations that limit development in flood zones

Projects that recharge groundwater aquifers through capturing a portion of stormwater/flood flows (maintaining flows for downstream riparian areas)

Use of stormwater/flood flows as an alternative water source for agriculture and bosque riparian areas

Improve EBID infrastructure to conserve water

Reduce flood risks and sediment transport through improving built infrastructure

Add ability for flood control dams to store stormwater for agricultural and recharge use
