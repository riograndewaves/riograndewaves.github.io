Here are some projects that Rio Grande Waves are proposing. 

- Trickle charging the aquifer
  - We propose a simple project : to maintain low-level flows in the Rio Grande outside of the irrigation season that will recharge the aquifer through the river channel, support native habitat, while at the same time keeping all of the water in New Mexico in an efficient storage location ... the aquifer.  At the WRRI workshop, it was stated that the most effective location to recharge the aquifer is through the river channel. The best native habitat is also located along the river channel; however, the ability to restore habitat is severely limited by the lack of water in the river for a large fraction of the year. Given drought and surface water shortage, farmers irrigate predominantly from the aquifer. Finally, evaporative losses from the aquifer are negligible and far less than from a reservoir.
We propose that low level in-stream flows be maintained year-round to achieve these goals. When there is no requirement for downstream delivery, the flows should be reduced to a minimum, but non-zero, level, and can be adjusted such that water flows no farther than the state line. The goal is for all of the water that is released off-season to trickle down into the aquifer and to support habitat along the river corridor.

- Implementation of IBWC aquatic habitat restoration sites

- Enhancement of IBWC active riparian restoration projects and no-mow/do-not-go floodway - with a focus on focal species

- IBWC riparian restoration projects that were identified but not pursued

- Restoration of riparian (minimum size ~ 80 hectares) and wetland habitat in Caballo Reservoir benefiting Southwestern Willow Flycatcher and Yellow-billed Cuckoo

- A Program targeting voluntary fallowing of surface and groundwater pumping along ephemeral stream systems and arroyos entering the Caballo Reservoir in Sierra County

- Dedication of stormwater capture to augment river flows during low-flow events
